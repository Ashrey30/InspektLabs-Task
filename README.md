# Document Classification and OCR Solution

## Objective

The goal of this project is to streamline document handling and processing for our client by developing a solution that classifies documents into predefined categories and extracts key fields from those documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

## Project Breakdown

### 1. Document Classification

#### Objective:
Automatically classify documents (images) into predefined categories such as accident reports, alcohol reports, etc.

#### Approach:
- **Rule-based model**: A classification model has been built using a rule-based approach, which looks for specific keywords in-order to classifiy.
- **Dataset**: Sample images provided in the Google Drive folder will be used to train and validate the model.

#### Deliverables:
- A trained classification model capable of categorizing documents into the predefined categories.
- A report detailing the classification methodology, model accuracy, and any improvements made during development.

### 2. Document OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

#### Objective:
Extract specific fields from the classified documents to facilitate further processing.

#### Approach:
- **Field Identification**: Key fields such as date, report number, and incident details will be identified and annotated in the sample documents.
- **OCR Development**: An OCR solution has been developed to accurately extract these fields from the images.

#### Deliverables:
- Annotated images highlighting the fields to be extracted.
- A script or OCR model to extract the specific fields from documents.
- Documentation outlining the extracted fields, challenges encountered, and the performance of the OCR solution.
